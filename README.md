# Sorting algorithm visualizer

This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick sort.

## Purpose

I made this sorting visualizer web application to improve my skills more in
HTML, CSS, and JS. And to help the beginners in programming to gain more knowledge and understanding on sorting algorithms by visualizing them.

## Sorting algorithms inside this application

This application supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**.
2. **Insertion Sort**.
3. **Selection Sort**.
4. **Merge Sort**.
5. **Quick Sort**.

## Meet the Algorithms

1. `Bubble sort` is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. The worst case complexity are of Ο(n*n) where n is the number of items.

2. `Insertion Sort` is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list. The worst case complexity are of Ο(n*n), where n is the number of items.

3. `Selection sort` is a in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. The worst case complexities are of Ο(n*n), where n is the number of items.

4. `Merge sort` is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log(n)), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

5. `Quick sort` is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. The average and worst-case complexity are O(n log(n)) and Ο(n*n), respectively.
